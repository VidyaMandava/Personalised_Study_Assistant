Two main subcategories are Textbook Question Answering (TQA) and Math Word Problem (MWP) solving.  TQA involves understanding multimodal information (text, images, diagrams) from textbooks to answer questions, while MWP solving translates narrative descriptions into mathematical expressions.  Challenges include comprehending complex questions and contexts, and bridging the gap between natural language and abstract representations.  Solutions involve deep learning methods (RNNs, CNNs), attention mechanisms, and pre-training with domain-specific knowledge.  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, often with strategies like Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve reasoning and zero/few-shot capabilities.  Datasets like SCIENCE QA and GSM8K are used for evaluation."
